**DeepFashion-MultiModal** is a large-scale high-quality human dataset with rich multi-modal annotations. It has the following properties:
1. It contains 44,096 high-resolution human images, including 12,701 full body human images.
2. For each full body images, we **manually annotate** the human parsing labels of 24 classes.
3. For each full body images, we **manually annotate** the keypoints.
4. We extract DensePose for each human image.
5. Each image is **manually annotated** with attributes for both clothes shapes and textures.
6. We provide a textual description for each image.

DeepFashion-MultiModal can be applied to text-driven human image generation, text-guided human image manipulation, skeleton-guided human image generation, human pose estimation, human image captioning, multi-modal learning for human images, human attribute recognition, human parsing prediction, and etc. The dataset is proposed in [Text2Human](https://github.com/yumingj/Text2Human).

## Human Parsing Label
* Mask labels are defined as follows:

| Label list | | | |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| 0: 'background' | 1: 'top' | 2: 'outer' | 3: 'skirt' |
| 4: 'dress' | 5: 'pants' | 6: 'leggings' | 7: 'headwear' |
| 8: 'eyeglass' | 9: 'neckwear' | 10: 'belt' | 11: 'footwear' |
| 12: 'bag' | 13: 'hair' | 14: 'face' | 15: 'skin' |
| 16: 'ring' | 17: 'wrist wearing' | 18: 'socks' | 19: 'gloves' |
| 20: 'necklace' | 21: 'rompers' | 22: 'earrings' | 23: 'tie' |

* You can read the labels using the following code:

```python
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np

segm = Image.open(f)
segm = np.array(segm) # shape: [750, 1101]
```

## Keypoints
* For each human image, we provide 21 keypoints. The keypoints are defined as follows:

<img src="./assets/keypoints_definition.png" width="20%">

* The `keypoints_loc.txt` file contains the coordinates of the keypoints. The format is as follows:
```
<img name> <x_1> <y_1> <x_2> <y_1> ... <x_21> <y_21>
```
&ensp; If the keypoints are not present, the keypoint is (-1, -1).

* The `keypoints_vis.txt` file indicates the visibility of the keypoints. The format is as follows:
```
<img name> <v_1> <v_2> ... <v_21>
```
&ensp; If the keypoint is visible, the value is 0. If the keypoint is present but hidden by other parts, the value is 1. If the keypoint is not present, the value is 2.

## DensePose
* We extract DensePose using this [repo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/DensePose). Please refer to this repo for more details.

## Labels
### Shape Annotations
* The definitions of shape annotations:
```
  0. sleeve length: 0 sleeveless, 1 short-sleeve, 2 medium-sleeve, 3 long-sleeve, 4 not long-sleeve, 5 NA
  1. lower clothing length: 0 three-point, 1 medium short, 2 three-quarter, 3 long, 4 NA
  2. socks: 0 no, 1 socks, 2 leggings, 3 NA
  3. hat: 0 no, 1 yes, 2 NA
  4. glasses: 0 no, 1 eyeglasses, 2 sunglasses, 3 have a glasses in hand or clothes, 4 NA
  5. neckwear: 0 no, 1 yes, 2 NA

  10. outer clothing a cardigan?: 0 yes, 1 no, 2 NA
  11. upper clothing covering navel: 0 no, 1 yes, 2 NA

  Note: 'NA' means the relevant part is not visible.
```

* The format of shape annotations:
```

  Note: 'NA' means the relevant part is not visible.
```

* The format of fabric annotations:
```

* **CelebA-Dialog** ⇒ [[Website](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA/CelebA_Dialog.html)] </br>
CelebA-Dialog is a large-scale visual-language face dataset. It has two properties: </br>
(1) Facial images are annotated with **rich fine-grained labels**, which classify one attribute into multiple degrees according to its semantic meaning.</br>
(2) Accompanied with each image, there are **captions describing** the attributes and a **user request sample**.
  * **Detailed information (Images & Text Descriptions):**
    * Number of identities: 10,177
    * Number of images: 202,599
    * 5 fine-grained attributes annotations per image: Bangs, Eyeglasses, Beard, Smiling, and Age

* **DeepFashion** ⇒ [[Website](https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/DeepFashion.html)] </br>
DeepFashion is a clothes database, which has several appealing properties: </br>
(1) DeepFashion contains over **800,000** diverse fashion images ranging from well-posed shop images to unconstrained consumer photos, constituting the largest visual fashion analysis database. </br>
(2) DeepFashion is annotated with rich information of clothing items. Each image in this dataset is labeled with **50** categories, **1,000** descriptive attributes, bounding box and clothing landmarks. </br>
(3) DeepFashion contains over **300,000** cross-pose/cross-domain image pairs.
